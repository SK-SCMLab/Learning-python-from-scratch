## 👶🏻 Introduction to Python
### *What is Python?*
Python is a general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and ease of use. 
i. In web development, Python frameworks like Django, FastAPI, and Flask let developers build scalable and secure backend systems with minimal effort
ii. Cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers use Python to detect vulnerabilities like malware and other viruses, build automated security scans, and analyze threats.
iii. Python runs well on microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi and MicroPython-compatible boards, so you can build all kinds of IoT projects like smart home devices, weather monitoring stations, and more
iv. Libraries like Selenium and BeautifulSoup also make it easy to interact with websites, so you can scrape public data, automate tasks through a web UI, and even manage cloud deployments for your projects
v. Libraries like Pandas and Numpy make data analysis less tedious, while others like Tensorflow and Scikit make machine learning and working with AI models much more accessible
